# dimg-api

This is meant to crudely mock the endpoints for a class project that goes by the
name Distributed Interactive Mobile Gaming Framework. The API is meant to tell
the consumer what the latest version of DIMG Framework is available.

A Docker container for this can be found at
https://hub.docker.com/r/mattmahn/dimg-api/.
